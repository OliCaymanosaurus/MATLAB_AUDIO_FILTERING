# MATLAB_AUDIO_FILTERING
Final project from Introduction to Engineering and Programming with MATLAB at Summer@Brown Pre-College Program. It focuses on audio signal processing techniques, including bass and treble enhancement, waveform visualization, and frequency spectrum analysis.

ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
code.m: Main MATLAB script performing audio processing tasks.

audio_files/: Contains the original and processed .wav audio files.

signal_graphs/: Stores generated plots showcasing waveform and frequency spectrum analyses.

README.md: Documentation detailing project objectives, usage, and structure.

Usage
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/OliCaymanosaurus/MATLAB_AUDIO_FILTERING.git

2. Open code.m in MATLAB.
3. Ensure the desired .wav file is placed in the audio_files/ directory.
4. Run the script to perform audio processing and generate visualizations.

ðŸŽ¨ Features
Waveform Visualization: Plots the amplitude of the audio signal over time.

Frequency Spectrum Analysis: Displays the power spectrum in decibels, highlighting frequency components.

Bass Enhancement: Applies a low-pass filter to amplify lower frequencies.

Treble Enhancement: Utilizes a high-pass filter to boost higher frequencies.

Audio Output: Generates and saves processed audio files for both bass and treble enhancements.
